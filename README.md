# Oklahoma State IEM 4013 Final Project

### *Spring 2023 -- Redistricting the state of Nebraska*

This is the repository for Team PLS in Dr. Buchanan's Spring 2023 Operations Research class. For our final project, we formulated an IP to re-apportion Nebraska's congressional districts using gurobi, NetworkX, and Gerrychain, with data visualization done with geopandas.

In this repo, you will find our final project report and Jupyter notebook containing the code for the IP. Please see the findings of the final report for an in-depth dissection of our model selection, along with a summary detailing the legal & political criteria we accounted for in the model.
